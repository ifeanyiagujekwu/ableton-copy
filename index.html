        </h3>
        <p>Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us 
            use Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural and 
            professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught, 
            and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared 
            belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute 
            to something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.

            <p>
                Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our 
                people what they need to work their magic and grow. We’ve learned 
                that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are 
                richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider 
                set of perspectives. We don’t always agree with each other, 
                but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.

        <h3>We’re passionate about what we do, but we’re equally passionate

            <p>
                We work hard to foster an environment where people can grow 
                both personally and professionally, and we strive to create a wealth of 
                opportunities to learn from and with each other. Alongside an 
                internal training program, employees are actively supported in 
                acquiring new knowledge and skills, and coached on applying these in 
                their daily work. In addition, staff-organized development and music 
                salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and best practices.
