            use Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural and 
            professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught, 
            and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared 
            belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute 
            to something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.
